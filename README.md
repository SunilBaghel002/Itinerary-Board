# Travel Itinerary Planner

A responsive and interactive travel itinerary planner that allows users to visualize and manage their travel plans using a map-based interface. The application utilizes `trip.js` to store and display travel destinations and activities, and leverages **Leaflet.js** for rich map visualizations. Trip data (e.g., Haridwar, Rishikesh, Manali) is stored locally using **LocalStorage**, ensuring persistence between sessions without a backend.
